            <p>Welcome to the Shootout Challenge! In this game, your objective is to shoot enemies before they attack
                you. Be quick and aim carefully to score points!</p>
            <p>Enemies will appear randomly from one of three directions: left, center, or right. You must shoot them

            <p>The game will speed up as you score more points, so stay alert and try to reach 10 points before the
                enemy does. Click "Start Game" to begin and good luck!</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Shootout Challenge! Get ready for an exciting shooting game where you'll need to use your
                skills and quick reflexes to outshoot the enemy. Hereâ€™s how to play:</p>

                <li><strong>Enemy Appearance:</strong> Enemies will randomly appear from one of three directions: left,
                    center, or right. You need to stay alert as they approach.</li>
                <li><strong>Shooting the Enemy:</strong> Your goal is to shoot the enemy before it shoots you. If you
                    shoot the enemy first, you score a point.</li>
                <li><strong>Increasing Difficulty:</strong> As you score more points, the game speeds up. The faster you
                    shoot, the quicker the enemy gets!</li>
                <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The first player to score 10 points wins the game. Keep playing
                    and improve your shooting speed to beat the enemy!</li>
